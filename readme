Assignment # 1 Linux System Calls and Library Functions
Details 
The goal of this homework is to become familiar with the environment in HOARE while practicing system calls. I’ll try to show the use of perror and getopt in this submission.
The programming task requires you to create a utility to traverse a specified directory in breadth-first order. Breadth-first search explores all the nodes at a given level before descending lower in the tree. Breadth-first search is implemented with a queue. As the program encounters each directory node at a level, it enqueues the pathname for later examination. 
We can use the following pseudocode which makes use of queue ADT.
breadthfirst ( root )
 { 
     enqueue ( root );  
      while ( ! empty ( queue ) )  
         { 
            next = dequeue ( queue ); 
            for each node directly below next 
             { visit ( node  );
                 if ( isa_directory ( node ) )
                  enqueue ( node ); 
              } 
             } 
       }

The executable will be called bt. It will be invoked by:

 bt [-h] [-L -d -g -i -p -s -t -u | -l] [dirname]
 
 example 
 ./bt -h




Option	The options are to be interpreted as follows
h	Print a help message and exit.
L	Follow symbolic links, if any. Default will be to not follow symbolic links.
t	Print information on file type.
p	Print permission bits as rwxrwxrwx.
i	Print the number of links to file in inode table.
u	Print the UID associated with the file.
g	Print the GID associated with the file.
s	Print the size of file in bytes. If the size is larger than 1K, indicate the size in KB with a suffix K; if the size is larger than 1M, indicate the size in MB with a suffix M; if the size is larger than 1G, indicate the size in GB with a suffix G.
d	Show the time of last modification.
l	This option will be used to print information on the file as if the options tpiugs are all specified.

If the user does not specify dirname, run the command using current directory and print the tree accordingly.
With the use of perror with some meaningful error messages. The format for error messages should be:
bt: Error: Detailed error message
where bt is actually the name of the executable (argv[0]) and should be appropriately modified if the name of executable is changed without recompilation. These error messages should be sent to stderr using perror. 
It is required for this project that you use version control, a Makefile, and a README.

I was able to use github.com
https://github.com/vjtarun/os_ass1

I created a partial bt.c
which uses getopt function and stderr ( which was the intent)

I created makefile and readme.

What is left is real program which does a bfs, used a queue, and prints the results.
I want to learn it and do it.I will try to complete it by today if not I will keep on working on it as a learning project.

HOW TO RUN:
1.In your command promt, type: make
2.This will generate .o file and executable file
3.To use the program, type: ./bt [dirname]
You then will see the list of directory and file in your current working directory or selected path directory.
For more option with this program, type: ./bt -h
Few example:
./bt -L [dirname] : follow symbolic link in the path that was given.
./bt -u [dirname] : display uid of the directory, file, and symbolic link.
./bt -d [dirname] : display the last modification date of the directory, file, and symbolic link.
